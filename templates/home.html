        <h2>ðŸ”§ What is Mechulate?</h2>
        <p>Mechulate is a mini engineering lab (a mechulator)â€”made for students, by a student. Here, youâ€™ll find tools to explore core engineering ideas.</p>
        <p>Whether itâ€™s calculating how much a beam bends or understanding gear ratios, Mechulate gives you tools to learn by doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>ðŸš€ Why I Built This</h2>
        <p>I'm a 15-year-old student in Nigeria, passionate about mechanical engineering and programming. I started Mechulate to help students like me see the fun side of engineering.</p>
        <p>This is more than a website. Itâ€™s my passion projectâ€”the kind of thing I wish existed when I first started learning.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ“˜ Learn the Concepts</h2>

        <h3>Beam Deflection</h3>
        <p>
            Beam deflection refers to how much a structural element (like a beam) bends under a load. 
            It's a fundamental concept in structural and mechanical engineering because it tells us whether 
            a structure can safely support weight without bending too much or breaking.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Beam deflection matters because it ensures safety by preventing structural 
            failure and optimizes material use for cost-effective, reliable designs.</p>
        <p>
            Engineers calculate deflection when designing buildings, bridges, aircraft wings, car frames, and 
            more. Knowing how much a beam will bend helps prevent failures, improve safety, and optimize material use.
        </p>
        <h3>Gear Ratio</h3>
        <p>
            Gear ratios compare the number of teeth on two gears and determine how speed and torque are transferred. 
            They are crucial in machines, vehicles, robotics, and any system that involves rotational motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A high gear ratio increases torque (good for climbing hills), while a low gear ratio increases speed 
            (great for racing). Understanding gear ratios helps engineers design efficient transmissions, robots, 
            and mechanical systems that work just right for the job.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Gear ratios control how torque and speed are transferred in machines. From cars to bicycles to industrial
            robots, understanding gear ratios is essential for designing systems that move efficiently and reliably.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Stress</h3>
        <p>
            Stress is the force applied to a material divided by the area it's applied to. Think of pressing 
            your finger on a table â€” the harder you press and the smaller your finger, the more stress the table feels.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Stress measures the internal force within materials under load. Engineers use it to predict whether
            a structure will hold or fail â€” making it vital for designing safe bridges, engines, buildings, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>Strain</h3>
        <p>
            Strain is how much a material stretches or compresses when stress is applied. It's a measure of 
            deformation â€” how much a material changes shape under force.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Strain shows how much a material deforms under stress. It helps engineers understand flexibility, 
            stretch, and potential failure â€” especially in materials like metal, plastic, or even bones in biomechanics.
